# statsviaexplainanalyze

Analyzing execution plans is made easier with curating statistics of database objects such as tables, indexes, or columns involved in the execution plan, all within a single report. This makes it easier to share among team members and reduces the need for additional information requests.

This tool automates the curation of object statistics when analyzing problematic execution plans in PostgreSQL using an HTML template and the `psql` command line.
